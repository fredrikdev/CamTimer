# CamTimer
CamTimer is a Windows application that allows timing your webcam - so that it automatically takes a picture e.g. every hour. It was released with its complete source code in 2012. If you're in need for examples of how to use your webcam from C# please check out **Classes\WebCamClasses.cs** which contains one approach for *DirectShow*, another for *WIA*, and a third one using *Avicap32*.
