Welcome to CamTimer
---------------------------
CamTimer is a Windows application that allows timing your webcam - so that it automatically takes a picture e.g. every hour. It was released with its complete source code in 2012. If you're in need for examples of how to use your webcam from C# please check out Classes\WebCamClasses.cs which contains one approach for Directshow, another for WIA, and a third one using Avicap32.

Requirements & Installation
---------------------------
This version of CamTimer was tested on Windows XP, Windows Vista (32/64 bit) & Windows 7. Hovever, you should be able to run it on most versions of Windows. For advanced Webcam support, Microsoft DirectX 9.0c or later is required. After installing CamTimer, the application will start up automatically.
